# Prompt: Generalize a Specific Workflow with Intelligent Placeholders (Human + Runtime Context)

## Task
-You are given a detailed, step-by-step workflow describing how a user completes a task through a web interface or digital tool.
-Your goal is to **generalize** the workflow while preserving its structure, sequence, and clarity -- but replacing any overly specific details with meaningful, reusable placeholders.

##  Generalization Rules

1. **Preserve the original structure and step-by-step format**:
   - Include `Step Title`, `Action`, `UI Hint`, `Inputs`, `Tips` or `Decision Points` where available

2. **Only replace values with user placeholders** if they must be provided externally:
   - e.g., company names, school names, campaign list names, filter terms, custom labels, filter names , person names 

3. **Preserve runtime-resolved information** using descriptive memory-aware placeholders:
   - Use: `[name of the person you identified earlier]`
   - Use: `[product found in previous step]`
   - Use: `[result selected from earlier search]`

4. **Do NOT remove contextual UI hints or clues**  
   -These are critical for human or agent operators and should remain intact (e.g., "top-left search bar", "Add button in modal").

5. **Do NOT remove the platform names or the application names the user is using**
   - These things are necessary , Like if the task involves use of Linkedin , we will preserve Linkedin , please determine from reading the task summary what the platform is.


## Few Shot Examples of Generalisation

### Task 1 : Open Gmail and read unread mails and press the add to calendar to create a meeting event
  ** Here we will generalise "Email titled- Regarding Meeting" because it can be anything

### Task 2 : Search for relevant people in the given VC firm on Linkedin 
** Here we can generalise the term 'blume ventures' as this can be variable everytime and is required as an input by the User

###Task 3: Go through my email and generate replies to emails from AJVC 
  ** Here we will not generalise AJVC as it is a necessary variable as given by the task from the user 

### **Generalized Tasks**

---

### **Task 1**: Set up a Zoom meeting with Latest interviewee

**Suppose we find the latest interviewee name to be John Abraham , Here we will generalize "John Abraham"** as this is a dynamic value that will change with each user and is not specified as a fixed part of the task.

---

### **Task 2**: Send an email to follow up on a proposal

**Here we will generalize the email subject and follow-up message** because these are dependent on the context and not fixed by the user’s instruction.

---

### **Task 3**: In Notion, download the latest report

**Suppose the latest Report is 'Quaterly Insights' Here we will “Quarterly Insights”** because the report name is a variable input that could be anything the user chooses.

---

### **Task 4**: In Salesforce, filter data using North and Q2

**Here we will generalize “North” and “Q2”** because these are user-provided filter values and can vary with each task execution.

---

### **Task 5**: Search and log a call for Neha Kapoor in CRM

**Here we will generalize “Neha Kapoor”** because the contact name is not fixed and will be provided differently each time by the user.

---

### **Preserved Tasks**

---

### **Task 6**: Go through my email and generate replies to emails from AJVC

**Here we will not generalize AJVC** as it is a necessary variable explicitly provided by the user as part of the task instruction.

---

### **Task 7**: Search “Google Software Engineers” on LinkedIn and list top 4 profiles

**Here we will not generalize “Google Software Engineers”** because the user has clearly defined the search query they want to be used.

---

### **Task 8**: Check campaign updates on Naukri for “Tech Hiring 2024”

**Here we will not generalize “Tech Hiring 2024”** because it is the specific campaign the user asked to review and is part of the task’s intent.

---

### **Task 9**: Find candidates from IIM Ahmedabad on LinkedIn

**Here we will not generalize “IIM Ahmedabad”** since it is part of the search criteria explicitly defined by the user.

---

### **Task 10**: Search for tweets mentioning Ripplica and draft replies

**Here we will not generalize “Ripplica”** because it is the subject the user wants to monitor and respond to — a necessary input.
